This means they can reproduce insecure code—but only because they’ve seen it in certain repositories.\\nIf I were a malicious hacker, I would create repositories with insecure code, spread links to them, and let scrapers find them. Then I’d hope that some model would pick up my insecure code and use it as a datasets for training.\\nWhat does this mean? It means that LLMs themselves aren’t insecure, but their datasets can be. This risk only emphasizes the importance of high-quality data sources. That’s the weak point—not the design of the LLM, but its knowledge sources.'},\n",

Dobrá strategie je vždy extrémně promyšlená.\\nOdhady, kolik Číňanů pracuje v Číně na výrobcích, které se pak prodávají v USA, se různí. Ale bezpečná hodnota je 50 milionů.\\nJenže i těchto 50 milionů nových pracujících bude generovat další spotřebu, takže nakonec jsme na cca 58 milionech nových duší.\\nJe teď otázka, zda-li těch 58 milionů mají být noví Američané s americkým občanstvím, ale jejich náhlým zjevením bychom se dostávali do oblasti náboženství.\\nNebo se bude jednat o imigranty? V USA je nyní 7,1 milionů nezaměstnaných. To nestačí na pokrytí potřeby. Míra nezaměstnanosti je 4,2 %.\\nJak jsme si řekli, dobrá strategie je vždy výborně promyšlená. Takže americká administrativa bude muset říci, v jakých místech se tito noví pracující objeví. V New Yorku nebo San Franciscu moc míst pro nové továrny nebude.\\nMusí být pro ně kapacitně připraveny byty, školky, lékaři, pekaři, silnice a letiště a další. To si bude vyžadovat další a další pracující.\\nMusí být připravena politika, jaké Američany vlastně americká vláda chce. Např. \"40 mil. nových Američanů bude šít oblečení a dělat plastové hračky\".\\nKaždá strategie má svoje trade-offs. Takže jemně upozorňuji, že oblečení a plastové hračky mají většinou nízkou přidanou hodnotu. Takže klesne HDP USA na osobu.\\nPrudký nárůst zaměstnanosti sebou samozřejmě většinou přináší i vyšší inflaci a Dutch disease, tedy nezdravé bohatnutí v některých oblastech, což ale časem otřese celou ekonomikou.\\nProto se při strategiích dělají ty různé PESTLE a podobné analýzy, aby později nikdo nemohl říci: \"Aha, to jsme nedomysleli.\"\\nSamozřejmě, bude-li chtít získávání nových duší zrealizovat americká vláda v dalších čtyřech letech pomocí imigrace, musí rozjet masivní náborové akce v zahraničí a zařídit veškerou politicko-administrativní infrastrukturu, jako třeba úředníky nebo pohraničníky. Což znamená potřebu dalších pracovníků. A samozřejmě budovat pozitivní obraz USA jako \"Best place to work for immigrants\".\\nPokud by si USA chtěli vyrábět i více vlastních aut, letadel (Delta, JetBlue i Frontier odebírají Airbus), léků, strojírenství atd., pak se počet dalších nových pracovníků v USA zvedá o vyšší desítky, možná i nižší stovky milionů.\\nP. S. Jeden člen naší rodiny se rozhodl, že bude péct doma pečivo. Asi po pěti dnech to vzdal, když zjistil, že když Sumerové před 5 000 lety objevili dělbu práce, že to je celkem užitečný vynález.\\nP. P. S. Pokud by Amerika chtěla, aby Čína odebírala z USA více zboží, jaké to má být? Má Čína nakupovat z USA zbraně, elektroniku, oblečení nebo třeba potraviny?'},\n",

       "  'text': '### Art of Destruction\\nSome people are afraid of breaking things. I am not one of them - I enjoy it.\\nI’ve learned most of the interesting stuff by breaking things. Yes, sometimes destruction is challenging, and I have to recover a project from a backup, but I can usually fix it. I do it in a dev or sandbox environment, so no real harm is done.\\nThe good side of intentional destruction is that if something breaks in production, I usually know what went wrong because I’ve seen many things break before.\\nBreaking things is good. It helps me understand how they work and where their weak points are. It also makes it easier to work with new technologies because I’m not afraid of breaking them. If I break something, I can recover it - that’s the other side of the same coin. This is also useful when writing an incident response plan. By breaking things, I gain a better understanding of potential failures and can create scenarios to address them.\\nIt also makes me a better programmer. I started using BurpSuite for website and API testing. Before that, I had some idea of how requests and responses worked, but it was only partial knowledge. Debuggers catch only certain requests and responses, but BurpSuite reveals how complex communication really is. There are requests you never even think about. It’s also fun to modify and replay requests to see how the system reacts. It opens up a new world of penetration testing and a new way of thinking.\\nhashtag\\n#\\ntesting\\nhashtag\\n#\\nBurpSuite\\nhashtag\\n#\\nsecurity'},\n",

       "  'text': \"### It's a Man's World\\nAs a sociology student, I attended classes with Gerlinde Šmaus, a well-known gender studies professor. I know that many people have a problem with gender studies and call it fake science, but that’s only because they don’t understand it.\\nYes, we have biological organs, but gender is something different - it’s a social concept. We create certain expectations based on gender. For example, I’m male, so people assume I should enjoy driving, but I hate it. In my family, cooking and grocery shopping are my responsibilities. I believe I’m a better cook than my wife, and she’s fine with that. Another example: I love my daughter. I take her to school every day and pick her up twice a week. That’s my duty. I can adjust the schedule if I have a workshop, but I wouldn’t change it regularly because it would negatively impact my wife’s business.\\nLast week, I went on a trip with the children. I expected to see more fathers there, but I realized I was the only man in a group of seven people. I know some of the children and their mothers, but I’ve never met their fathers. Is this biological determination? No, it isn’t. It’s simply a social construct that leads people to believe childcare isn’t a man’s job.\\nWe often reject certain fields of knowledge simply because we don’t understand them. In programming, things are often either true or false. But in real life (and also in GenAI), it's a spectrum. We are more than just our roles. Roles exist to help people categorize and understand, but reality is far more complex and difficult to define. And that is the reason why people hate gender studies - it is too difficult to understand.\"},\n",

       "  'text': '# Can You Share? Sharing Is Caring! Or Not? What I Learned from OSINT\\nOSINT is short for Open Source Intelligence. It means retrieving information from public sources. Public sources include all types of media, social networks, catalogs, registers, websites, and much more. We are sharing information everywhere.\\nI used to have a public mobile phone. I mean, it’s still public, but that’s why I blocked all calls from unknown numbers. The first problem is spam; the second problem with a public phone is scammers. Anyone with basic IT skills can spoof any phone number. It’s not difficult, and it’s also not illegal. This means a scammer can call someone using your phone number (which is illegal). We can’t trust incoming calls. That’s why I’m hesitant to share my mobile phone publicly.\\nI have several email accounts. For sensitive services, I use a \"secret email\" that isn\\'t publicly known. This adds an extra layer of security, making it harder to hack through social engineering or brute force.\\nFor example, imagine you have an account on a service that exposes information publicly. We also know that spoofing a phone number isn’t difficult. Now, imagine your email and phone number are publicly available, and an attacker knows you have an account on a specific service. You receive a call from a number that appears to be associated with that company. To simplify, imagine you share information about your bank, and your phone number is public. Then, you receive a call from what looks like your bank, and the caller claims you need to take urgent action. This is a common spear-phishing attack.\\nWhen searching for a job or looking for candidates, sharing some information is necessary. However, we should always consider the risks we create by doing so.\\nhashtag\\n#\\nOSINT\\nhashtag\\n#\\nphishing\\nhashtag\\n#\\nhacking\\nhashtag\\n#\\ninformationgathering'},\n",

I found that the teaching approach was always the same: don’t speak - just follow what your master does. If a student can reproduce the patterns, they will eventually understand their purpose. But if you understand the pattern but can’t execute it, then you’re not a good student.\\nProgramming, perhaps surprisingly, is similar to martial arts. You have to practice - again and again. You need to recognize patterns and follow them. In interviews, design patterns are a frequent topic, but I’m not sure if it’s necessary to understand every single one. A good programmer must be able to reproduce a pattern. Yes, if you understand a pattern, you can create it from scratch, but we live in a time where frameworks exist, and we don’t need to start every app from the ground up.\\nI believe the important part is understanding the pattern, being able to reproduce it, and knowing what it does. It’s not essential to know whether it’s called a singleton, MVC, builder, or factory. I know seniors with years of experience who aren’t able to do this. What’s more important is being able to apply the pattern effectively. Design patterns are useful when writing a new framework or transitioning between frameworks. However, in my view, the key isn’t being able to name the pattern - it’s being able to implement it.'},\n",

Instead, I want to talk about my weaknesses.\\n### First-Impression Disaster Specialist\\nAre you good at making a great first impression? I’m not. It takes time for people to start liking me. I have bad speaking habits: poor pronunciation, and I tend to speak too fast. Usually, I think of interesting questions after the meeting is over. I’m not great at small talk. While I understand the value of social interactions, I transitioned from social work (where I spent a few years) to IT because I realized I prefer interacting with computers over people.\\n### Not a Single-Topic Specialist\\nI studied at a veterinary high school, then earned a bachelor\\'s degree in andragogy and sociology. A few years later, I moved into online marketing, specifically SEO, and then into Drupal-based web development. I have 8+ years of experience with PHP, two years with Python, and one year with TypeScript. I’m also an AWS Certified Developer Associate and currently studying GenAI. Yep, I’ve taken some hacking courses too...\\nBut where is my strongest expertise? Some people criticize me for jumping from one topic to another. It’s true. I’ve written tons of PHP code, but do I understand everything? No. Without an IDE and documentation, my skills drop significantly. I rely on tools, and without them, I don’t know as much. My strength isn’t deep expertise in one topic—it’s a multidisciplinary approach, flexibility, and a passion for exploration.\\n### Not Naturally Gifted\\nAm I talented? I know people who are much better than me. I’m not a gifted genius. Everything I’ve achieved is the result of hard work and perseverance.\\nFor example, I’d love to speak better English. I have a personal teacher and try to use English as my primary working language. I’ve made progress, but I know I could be better. Some concepts take me multiple readings to fully grasp. That’s why I like Udemy courses—I can rewatch lessons as many times as needed. I’ve also spent a lot of time studying SOLID principles and design patterns, but I still wouldn’t say I fully understand them. I’m working on it. Occasionally, I look at old code and think, What the hell is this?—only to realize I wrote it. I’m not perfect, but I’m constantly \"debugging\" myself.\\n### I’m a Vegetarian\\nI’ve been a vegetarian for more than half my life. I’m not militant about it, but it’s not always easy to invite me to dinner. If you like Asian food, there’s no problem—most Asian restaurants have vegetarian options. Typically, I don’t eat lunch.\\n### Why Am I Writing This?\\nI don’t want to waste anyone’s time. I like efficiency. I have certain limitations, and it’s good to be aware of them before we start any negotiations. If you see red flags in what I’ve written, that’s great—it means we’re not a fit. If you don’t, then let’s discuss what we can do for each other.'},\n",

Objednávku v Alze jsem zrušil už minulou neděli, když mi bylo jasné, že produkt mají dražší a navíc a nedostupný... 5 dní po zrušení mi Alza píše, že je objednávka připravena. Jsou to fakt mimozemšťani.'},\n",

Dle mého názoru je to jen otázka časové prodlevy mezi frustrací a deprivací.\\nÚspěšný člověk má delší časový rozestup mezi frustrací a deprivací. Neúspěšný člověk je deprimován velmi rychle po počátku frustrace.\\nPozitivní je, že se to dá trénovat. Čím častěji je člověk frustrován, tím větší získává  odolnost vůči projevům frustrace a zároveň se prodlužuje časový rozestup mezi frustrací a deprivací. A to je vlastně vše, co je třeba k úspěchu.'},\n",

Dobrá strategie je vždy extrémně promyšlená.\\nOdhady, kolik Číňanů pracuje v Číně na výrobcích, které se pak prodávají v USA, se různí. Ale bezpečná hodnota je 50 milionů.\\nJenže i těchto 50 milionů nových pracujících bude generovat další spotřebu, takže nakonec jsme na cca 58 milionech nových duší.\\nJe teď otázka, zda-li těch 58 milionů mají být noví Američané s americkým občanstvím, ale jejich náhlým zjevením bychom se dostávali do oblasti náboženství.\\nNebo se bude jednat o imigranty? V USA je nyní 7,1 milionů nezaměstnaných. To nestačí na pokrytí potřeby. Míra nezaměstnanosti je 4,2 %.\\nJak jsme si řekli, dobrá strategie je vždy výborně promyšlená. Takže americká administrativa bude muset říci, v jakých místech se tito noví pracující objeví. V New Yorku nebo San Franciscu moc míst pro nové továrny nebude.\\nMusí být pro ně kapacitně připraveny byty, školky, lékaři, pekaři, silnice a letiště a další. To si bude vyžadovat další a další pracující.\\nMusí být připravena politika, jaké Američany vlastně americká vláda chce. Např. \"40 mil. nových Američanů bude šít oblečení a dělat plastové hračky\".\\nKaždá strategie má svoje trade-offs. Takže jemně upozorňuji, že oblečení a plastové hračky mají většinou nízkou přidanou hodnotu. Takže klesne HDP USA na osobu.\\nPrudký nárůst zaměstnanosti sebou samozřejmě většinou přináší i vyšší inflaci a Dutch disease, tedy nezdravé bohatnutí v některých oblastech, což ale časem otřese celou ekonomikou.\\nProto se při strategiích dělají ty různé PESTLE a podobné analýzy, aby později nikdo nemohl říci: \"Aha, to jsme nedomysleli.\"\\nSamozřejmě, bude-li chtít získávání nových duší zrealizovat americká vláda v dalších čtyřech letech pomocí imigrace, musí rozjet masivní náborové akce v zahraničí a zařídit veškerou politicko-administrativní infrastrukturu, jako třeba úředníky nebo pohraničníky. Což znamená potřebu dalších pracovníků. A samozřejmě budovat pozitivní obraz USA jako \"Best place to work for immigrants\".\\nPokud by si USA chtěli vyrábět i více vlastních aut, letadel (Delta, JetBlue i Frontier odebírají Airbus), léků, strojírenství atd., pak se počet dalších nových pracovníků v USA zvedá o vyšší desítky, možná i nižší stovky milionů.\\nP.

I do it in a dev or sandbox environment, so no real harm is done.\\nThe good side of intentional destruction is that if something breaks in production, I usually know what went wrong because I’ve seen many things break before.\\nBreaking things is good. It helps me understand how they work and where their weak points are. It also makes it easier to work with new technologies because I’m not afraid of breaking them. If I break something, I can recover it - that’s the other side of the same coin. This is also useful when writing an incident response plan. By breaking things, I gain a better understanding of potential failures and can create scenarios to address them.\\nIt also makes me a better programmer. I started using BurpSuite for website and API testing. Before that, I had some idea of how requests and responses worked, but it was only partial knowledge. Debuggers catch only certain requests and responses, but BurpSuite reveals how complex communication really is. There are requests you never even think about.

I know that many people have a problem with gender studies and call it fake science, but that’s only because they don’t understand it.\\nYes, we have biological organs, but gender is something different - it’s a social concept. We create certain expectations based on gender. For example, I’m male, so people assume I should enjoy driving, but I hate it. In my family, cooking and grocery shopping are my responsibilities. I believe I’m a better cook than my wife, and she’s fine with that. Another example: I love my daughter. I take her to school every day and pick her up twice a week. That’s my duty. I can adjust the schedule if I have a workshop, but I wouldn’t change it regularly because it would negatively impact my wife’s business.\\nLast week, I went on a trip with the children. I expected to see more fathers there, but I realized I was the only man in a group of seven people. I know some of the children and their mothers, but I’ve never met their fathers.

It’s simply a social construct that leads people to believe childcare isn’t a man’s job.\\nWe often reject certain fields of knowledge simply because we don’t understand them.

Sharing Is Caring! Or Not? What I Learned from OSINT\\nOSINT is short for Open Source Intelligence. It means retrieving information from public sources. Public sources include all types of media, social networks, catalogs, registers, websites, and much more. We are sharing information everywhere.\\nI used to have a public mobile phone. I mean, it’s still public, but that’s why I blocked all calls from unknown numbers. The first problem is spam; the second problem with a public phone is scammers. Anyone with basic IT skills can spoof any phone number. It’s not difficult, and it’s also not illegal. This means a scammer can call someone using your phone number (which is illegal). We can’t trust incoming calls. That’s why I’m hesitant to share my mobile phone publicly.\\nI have several email accounts. For sensitive services, I use a \"secret email\" that isn\\'t publicly known. This adds an extra layer of security, making it harder to hack through social engineering or brute force.\\nFor example, imagine you have an account on a service that exposes information publicly. We also know that spoofing a phone number isn’t difficult. Now, imagine your email and phone number are publicly available, and an attacker knows you have an account on a specific service. You receive a call from a number that appears to be associated with that company. To simplify, imagine you share information about your bank, and your phone number is public. Then, you receive a call from what looks like your bank, and the caller claims you need to take urgent action. This is a common spear-phishing attack.\\nWhen searching for a job or looking for candidates, sharing some information is necessary.

      "Pokud chtějí USA, aby se produkty z Číny vyráběly v USA, na což mají právo, je potřeba i říci, kdo je bude vyrábět.\n",
      "Ve strategii víme, že stanovovat cíle a vize nestačí. Dobrá strategie je vždy extrémně promyšlená.\n",
      "Odhady, kolik Číňanů pracuje v Číně na výrobcích, které se pak prodávají v USA, se různí. Ale bezpečná hodnota je 50 milionů.\n",
      "Jenže i těchto 50 milionů nových pracujících bude generovat další spotřebu, takže nakonec jsme na cca 58 milionech nových duší.\n",
      "Je teď otázka, zda-li těch 58 milionů mají být noví Američané s americkým občanstvím, ale jejich náhlým zjevením bychom se dostávali do oblasti náboženství.\n",
      "Nebo se bude jednat o imigranty? V USA je nyní 7,1 milionů nezaměstnaných. To nestačí na pokrytí potřeby. Míra nezaměstnanosti je 4,2 %.\n",
      "Jak jsme si řekli, dobrá strategie je vždy výborně promyšlená. Takže americká administrativa bude muset říci, v jakých místech se tito noví pracující objeví. V New Yorku nebo San Franciscu moc míst pro nové továrny nebude.\n",
      "Musí být pro ně kapacitně připraveny byty, školky, lékaři, pekaři, silnice a letiště a další. To si bude vyžadovat další a další pracující.\n",
      "Musí být připravena politika, jaké Američany vlastně americká vláda chce. Např. \"40 mil. nových Američanů bude šít oblečení a dělat plastové hračky\".\n",
      "Každá strategie má svoje trade-offs. Takže jemně upozorňuji, že oblečení a plastové hračky mají většinou nízkou přidanou hodnotu. Takže klesne HDP USA na osobu.\n",
      "Prudký nárůst zaměstnanosti sebou samozřejmě většinou přináší i vyšší inflaci a Dutch disease, tedy nezdravé bohatnutí v některých oblastech, což ale časem otřese celou ekonomikou.\n",
      "Proto se při strategiích dělají ty různé PESTLE a podobné analýzy, aby později nikdo nemohl říci: \"Aha, to jsme nedomysleli.\"\n",
      "Samozřejmě, bude-li chtít získávání nových duší zrealizovat americká vláda v dalších čtyřech letech pomocí imigrace, musí rozjet masivní náborové akce v zahraničí a zařídit veškerou politicko-administrativní infrastrukturu, jako třeba úředníky nebo pohraničníky. Což znamená potřebu dalších pracovníků. A samozřejmě budovat pozitivní obraz USA jako \"Best place to work for immigrants\".\n",
      "Pokud by si USA chtěli vyrábět i více vlastních aut, letadel (Delta, JetBlue i Frontier odebírají Airbus), léků, strojírenství atd., pak se počet dalších nových pracovníků v USA zvedá o vyšší desítky, možná i nižší stovky milionů.\n",
      "P. S. Jeden člen naší rodiny se rozhodl, že bude péct doma pečivo. Asi po pěti dnech to vzdal, když zjistil, že když Sumerové před 5 000 lety objevili dělbu práce, že to je celkem užitečný vynález.\n",

      "I started using OpenRefine as an SEO consultant when I needed a better way to analyze large datasets. Later, I used it for migrations, the analysis part of automation, and report generation. It’s the best tool for working with big and messy data.\n",
      "I've heard that most of what OpenRefine can do is also possible in Excel. So why use OpenRefine? The answer is simple. When working with millions of records, Excel fails even to open the file. OpenRefine may be slow with large datasets, but it still works. It also offers powerful filtering features, including facets, and allows mass editing and data transformation using GREL or Python.\n",

      "Text: ### Art of Destruction\n",
      "Some people are afraid of breaking things. I am not one of them - I enjoy it.\n",
      "I’ve learned most of the interesting stuff by breaking things. Yes, sometimes destruction is challenging, and I have to recover a project from a backup, but I can usually fix it. I do it in a dev or sandbox environment, so no real harm is done.\n",
      "The good side of intentional destruction is that if something breaks in production, I usually know what went wrong because I’ve seen many things break before.\n",
      "Breaking things is good. It helps me understand how they work and where their weak points are. It also makes it easier to work with new technologies because I’m not afraid of breaking them. If I break something, I can recover it - that’s the other side of the same coin. This is also useful when writing an incident response plan. By breaking things, I gain a better understanding of potential failures and can create scenarios to address them.\n",
      "It also makes me a better programmer. I started using BurpSuite for website and API testing. Before that, I had some idea of how requests and responses worked, but it was only partial knowledge. Debuggers catch only certain requests and responses, but BurpSuite reveals how complex communication really is. There are requests you never even think about. It’s also fun to modify and replay requests to see how the system reacts. It opens up a new world of penetration testing and a new way of thinking.\n",

      "As a sociology student, I attended classes with Gerlinde Šmaus, a well-known gender studies professor. I know that many people have a problem with gender studies and call it fake science, but that’s only because they don’t understand it.\n",
      "Yes, we have biological organs, but gender is something different - it’s a social concept. We create certain expectations based on gender. For example, I’m male, so people assume I should enjoy driving, but I hate it. In my family, cooking and grocery shopping are my responsibilities. I believe I’m a better cook than my wife, and she’s fine with that. Another example: I love my daughter. I take her to school every day and pick her up twice a week. That’s my duty. I can adjust the schedule if I have a workshop, but I wouldn’t change it regularly because it would negatively impact my wife’s business.\n",
      "Last week, I went on a trip with the children. I expected to see more fathers there, but I realized I was the only man in a group of seven people. I know some of the children and their mothers, but I’ve never met their fathers. Is this biological determination? No, it isn’t. It’s simply a social construct that leads people to believe childcare isn’t a man’s job.\n",
      "We often reject certain fields of knowledge simply because we don’t understand them. In programming, things are often either true or false. But in real life (and also in GenAI), it's a spectrum. We are more than just our roles. Roles exist to help people categorize and understand, but reality is far more complex and difficult to define. And that is the reason why people hate gender studies - it is too difficult to understand.\n",

      "OSINT is short for Open Source Intelligence. It means retrieving information from public sources. Public sources include all types of media, social networks, catalogs, registers, websites, and much more. We are sharing information everywhere.\n",
      "I used to have a public mobile phone. I mean, it’s still public, but that’s why I blocked all calls from unknown numbers. The first problem is spam; the second problem with a public phone is scammers. Anyone with basic IT skills can spoof any phone number. It’s not difficult, and it’s also not illegal. This means a scammer can call someone using your phone number (which is illegal). We can’t trust incoming calls. That’s why I’m hesitant to share my mobile phone publicly.\n",
      "I have several email accounts. For sensitive services, I use a \"secret email\" that isn't publicly known. This adds an extra layer of security, making it harder to hack through social engineering or brute force.\n",
      "For example, imagine you have an account on a service that exposes information publicly. We also know that spoofing a phone number isn’t difficult. Now, imagine your email and phone number are publicly available, and an attacker knows you have an account on a specific service. You receive a call from a number that appears to be associated with that company. To simplify, imagine you share information about your bank, and your phone number is public. Then, you receive a call from what looks like your bank, and the caller claims you need to take urgent action. This is a common spear-phishing attack.\n",
      "When searching for a job or looking for candidates, sharing some information is necessary. However, we should always consider the risks we create by doing so.\n",

      "I spent years practicing martial arts. I had different sifus/professors, trained in different styles, and experienced different cultural influences. I found that the teaching approach was always the same: don’t speak - just follow what your master does. If a student can reproduce the patterns, they will eventually understand their purpose. But if you understand the pattern but can’t execute it, then you’re not a good student.\n",
      "Programming, perhaps surprisingly, is similar to martial arts. You have to practice - again and again. You need to recognize patterns and follow them. In interviews, design patterns are a frequent topic, but I’m not sure if it’s necessary to understand every single one. A good programmer must be able to reproduce a pattern. Yes, if you understand a pattern, you can create it from scratch, but we live in a time where frameworks exist, and we don’t need to start every app from the ground up.\n",
      "I believe the important part is understanding the pattern, being able to reproduce it, and knowing what it does. It’s not essential to know whether it’s called a singleton, MVC, builder, or factory. I know seniors with years of experience who aren’t able to do this. What’s more important is being able to apply the pattern effectively. Design patterns are useful when writing a new framework or transitioning between frameworks. However, in my view, the key isn’t being able to name the pattern - it’s being able to implement it.\n",

      "1. **Can You Share? Sharing Is Caring! Or Not? What I Learned from OSINT**\n",
      "   - OSINT is short for Open Source Intelligence. It means retrieving information from public sources. Public sources include all types of media, social networks, catalogs, registers, websites, and much more. We are sharing information everywhere.\n",
      "   - I used to have a public mobile phone. I mean, it’s still public, but that’s why I blocked all calls from unknown numbers. The first problem is spam; the second problem with a public phone is scammers. Anyone with basic IT skills can spoof any phone number. It’s not difficult, and it’s also not illegal. This means a scammer can call someone using your phone number (which is illegal). We can’t trust incoming calls. That’s why I’m hesitant to share my mobile phone publicly.\n",
      "   - I have several email accounts. For sensitive services, I use a \"secret email\" that isn't publicly known. This adds an extra layer of security, making it harder to hack through social engineering or brute force.\n",
      "   - For example, imagine you have an account on a service that exposes information publicly. We also know that spoofing a phone number isn’t difficult. Now, imagine your email and phone number are publicly available, and an attacker knows you have an account on a specific service. You receive a call from a number that appears to be associated with that company. To simplify, imagine you share information about your bank, and your phone number is public. Then, you receive a call from what looks like your bank, and the caller claims you need to take urgent action. This is a common spear-phishing attack.\n",
      "   - When searching for a job or looking for candidates, sharing some information is necessary. However, we should always consider the risks we create by doing so.\n",
      "   - **Hashtags:** #OSINT #phishing #hacking #informationgathering\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **I am developing a RAG chatbot - a tool that enhances LLM knowledge with specific, private, or less-known information. Currently, I have a PDF and JSON processor. I'm considering which knowledge sources are essential for such an application.**\n",
      "   - **Hashtags:** #RAG #AI #chatbot\n",
